            I am an Australian who having travelled to many countries (but not
            enough) feel very at home in South East Qld. We have great weather
            all year round perfect for camping and going to the beach. I am
            hoping to do a lot more travel with Vietnam and Cambodia on my wish
            list.

            I am married and have three wonderful children. Our house is
            protected by the awesome Sunny, a cattle dog that loves life more
            than any other creature on Earth. I enjoy performing improv comedy
            and play acoustic guitar. I am a big cinema fan with Harry Potter,
            James Bond and Star Wars at the top of my list.

            I love the javaScript world. Despite a few run ins where I vowed
            "never never", I always come back and get amazed at what js can do........
